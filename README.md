# Selectæ e profanis scriptoribus historiæ (1727) 
By Jean Heuzet (1660 – 1728), a French humanist and professor at the Collège de Beauvais. *Selectæ* was intended to help someone learning Latin. I will be translating from the 1790 edition printed by L. J. Prud'homme.

| About my copy  |   |
|---|---|
| Description | A single volume containing two books, complete. Interesting, battered and ink covered cover, the front board of which seems to be covered in vellum, while the spine and back is covered in paper. The book is well read but the binding remains integral. The title page has watermark, laid paper, text block has a red ink speckled edge. The preface is written in french. There are black ink marginalia throughout. Some book worm action midway through the text.It has an index. The type is not particularly fine type and the page inking is  inconsisent. I find it beautiful. |
| Why I bought | This was the first old book I bought, I was amazed I could own something from an antique century. I was also intrigued by its being a latin text book, which I thought I could use for my own learning. The publication year in France also seemed interesting – after Bastille but before the reign of terror, with Louis XVI still on the throne and having books, like this one, printed in his name |
