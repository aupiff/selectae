# Selectæ e profanis scriptoribus historiæ (1727) 
By Jean Heuzet (1660 – 1728), a French humanist and professor at the Collège de Beauvais. *Selectæ* was intended to help someone learning Latin. I will be translating from my copy of the 1790 edition printed by L. J. Prud'homme.

| Why I bought | This was the first old book I bought, I was amazed I could own something from an antique century. I was also intrigued by its being in latin, and by its being a latin text book, which I thought I could use for my own learning. |
